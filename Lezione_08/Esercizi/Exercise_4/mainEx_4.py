    Create a class University:

    Attributes:

        name
        departments (list of Department instances)
        students (list of Student instances)

    Methods:

        add_department, to add a department to the university.
        add_student, to add a student to the university.
        __str__, method to return a string representation of the university.

    [7]
    Finally, write a simple driver program.
    After creating a University, you should begin by creating instances of the main components that
    make up a university:

        Departments (e.g., Computer Science, Literature)

        Courses (e.g., Data Structures, Medieval Literature)

        Professors (e.g., faculty members who will teach the courses)

        Students (e.g., individuals who will enroll in the courses)

    Once these instances are created, follow these steps:

        Add all entities to the university: Ensure the university class can register departments and students. 

        Enroll students in courses: Simulate student registration by assigning students to one or more courses. 

        Assign professors to courses: Each course should have a professor responsible for teaching it. 

        Display the state of the university:
        at each significant step, print out a summary of the universityâ€™s current state. This might include:
            A list of courses with assigned professors.
            Which students are enrolled in which courses.
            A breakdown of departments and the courses they offer.
