Login Attempts:

1.
    Add an attribute called login_attempts to your User class from Exercise 9-3.
    Write a method called increment_login_attempts()
    that increments the value of login_attempts by 1.

2.   
    Write another method called reset_login_attempts()
    that resets the value of login_attempts to 0.
  
3.
    Make an instance of the User class and call increment_login_attempts() several times.
    Print the value of login_attempts to make sure it was incremented properly,
    and then call reset_login_attempts().

4.
    Print login_attempts again to make sure it was reset to 0.
